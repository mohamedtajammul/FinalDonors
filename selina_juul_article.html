                        Graphic Arts Institute of Denmark). Selina has owned and operated her own business as an independent Illustrator and Graphic Designer since 2002.&nbsp;<br><strong>The Stop Wasting Food movement</strong><br>Environmental sustainability
                        and global responsibility have always been matters close to her heart, so in 2008 Selina Juul founded the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.stopwastingfoodmovement.org/">Stop Wasting Food movement Denmark (Stop Spild Af Mad)</a>. At the
                        present, Selina weekly puts about 40 hours of voluntary work into the movement, but the fight to minimize food waste is spreading, and new exciting challenges arise all the time.<br><br>Stop Wasting Food is Denmark's largest non-profit
                        consumer movement against food waste. Set up by consumers for consumers, Stop Wasting Food is an NGO that has constructively shaped public opinion in its drive to prevent food waste. It seeks to increase public awareness of the
                        throwaway society by organizing campaigns, mobilizing the press and media, and encouraging discussion, debate and events of all kinds, all with the aim of decreasing the current mountains of food waste. Stop Wasting Food is empowering
                        the consumers to take action and urges them to launch individual initiatives such as reducing their own food waste, cooking leftovers, shopping more wisely and distributing surplus food to shelters for the homeless.&nbsp;See more
